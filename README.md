# [IFT 6132 - Advanced Structures Prediction and Optimization](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~slacoste/teaching/ift6132/W18/)
**Professor.** Simon Lacoste-Julien

**Description.** Advanced topics for prediction of structured objects (such as graphs, couplings, flow networks). Generative learning vs. discriminative. Energy models. Conditional random fields. Structured and latent variable SVM, CCCP algorithms. Large-scale optimization: Frank-Wolfe, reduced variance SGD, block-coordinate methods. Learn to search. NNI. algorithms combinatorics: cost-min networks, sub-modular optimization, dynamic programming.

# [IFT 6135 - Deep Learning](https://ift6135h18.wordpress.com/category/lectures/)
**Professor.** Aaron Courville

**Description.** Advanced subjects in learning algorithms: deep architectures, neural networks and non-supervised probabilistic models.

# [IFT 6085 - Theoretical principles for deep learning](http://mitliagkas.github.io/ift6085-dl-theory-class-2019/)
**Professor.** Ioannis Mitliagkas

**Description.** This course consists of an overview of the most recent theoretical publications on deep learning. For each selected publication, Dr. Mitliagkas will introduce the theoretical concepts necessary to understand the scientific approach of the authors, but also the results presented. Several topics will be covered, such as the optimization of nonconvex functions and information theory. Since the main objective of this course is to introduce participants to new research in this area, the main evaluation of this course will be in the form of a research project.
